New release: 0.7.6
==================

- A issue which prevented Jackbeat to compile on recent 64bit Linux systems
  has been fixed. This affected Fedora 13, Ubuntu 10.10, Arch Linux and 
  possibly others.
- Jackbeat doesn't try and connect to PulseAudio by default anymore, since this
  may hang on certain systems. The PulseAudio output driver must be explicitly
  selected in the preferences.
